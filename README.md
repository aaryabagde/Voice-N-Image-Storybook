# Voice-N-Image-Storybook
# Storybook-Gen

Storybook-Gen is a tool that generates illustrated storybooks with text-to-speech narration. It creates beautiful illustrations for each chapter using OpenAI's API, and narrates the story using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). The generated storybook consists of both images and audio files, making it an engaging experience for both children and adults.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Automatically generates illustrations based on chapter descriptions using OpenAIâ€™s API.
- **Text-to-Speech Narration**: Converts the story text into audio narration using gTTS.
- **Easy Story Creation**: Easily create a storybook by providing story data (title, chapters, description, and text).
- **Local Image Saving**: The generated images are saved locally.
- **Audio Narration**: Each chapter is narrated, and the audio files are saved as MP3 files.
